# Lab 5: GraphRAG with Neo4j

## The Core of This Workshop

This lab teaches you to build **Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (GraphRAG) applications using the official `neo4j-graphrag` Python library.

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure documents in a graph for RAG
- Creating embeddings and vector indexes
- Building retrieval pipelines
- Graph-enhanced retrieval patterns

## Four Hands-On Notebooks

| Notebook | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| 01 | Document-Chunk graph structure |
| 02 | Embeddings and vector indexes |
| 03 | Basic GraphRAG pipeline |
| 04 | Graph-enhanced retrieval |
