# The GenAI Promise

## What LLMs Do Well

LLMs excel at tasks relying on pattern recognition and language fluency:

| Capability | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Text generation** | Responses, summaries, explanations |
| **Language understanding** | Parsing intent, following instructions |
| **Pattern completion** | Continuing sequences, filling blanks |
| **Translation** | Converting formats, styles, languages |

## The Promise

"Ask questions in natural language, get intelligent answers."

## But There Are Limits...

LLMs have fundamental limitations that affect their usefulness for real-world applications.
