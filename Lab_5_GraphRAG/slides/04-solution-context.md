# The Solution: Context

## All Three Problems Have One Solution

**Providing context** addresses all three LLM limitations:

| Problem | How Context Helps |
|---------|-------------------|
| Hallucination | Facts to work with |
| Knowledge Cutoff | Access to your data |
| Relationship Blindness | Structured information |

## RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Instead of relying on what the LLM "knows," we:

1. **Retrieve** relevant information from your data
2. **Augment** the LLM's prompt with this context
3. **Generate** a response grounded in facts

## The Key Insight

The LLM becomes a **reasoning engine** over your data, not a source of truth.
