# Lab 6: Aura Agents API

## From No-Code to Integration

In Lab 2, you built an Aura Agent using the visual builder. Now you'll learn to call it **programmatically**.

## Why Use the API?

| Use Case | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Application Integration** | Embed in web/mobile apps |
| **Automation** | Include in data pipelines |
| **Batch Processing** | Ask multiple questions |
| **Custom UIs** | Build your own chat interface |

## What You'll Learn

- OAuth2 authentication with the Neo4j API
- Making REST calls to your agent
- Parsing responses and extracting insights
- Token management and caching
