Neo4j GenAI Hands-On Lab  with AWS Program Template, 2026
Program Name
Build Generative AI & GraphRAG Agents with Neo4j and Amazon Bedrock
Target Audience:
Data Scientists, Data Engineers, AI Developers
Delivery Format:
3-Part Interactive Hands-On Lab
Duration:
3–4 hours (plus optional networking)
Venue Name: 
AWS Offices
Prereqs: 
Laptop with browser, AWS Console access, Neo4j Aura access.


Workshop Overview
This workshop equips participants with practical skills to combine Neo4j graph databases with AWS Amazon Bedrock GenAI capabilities to build explainable, context-aware AI applications using GraphRAG and agentic patterns.
Through a series of guided exercises, attendees will:
✅ Deploy and explore Neo4j knowledge graphs
✅ Understand foundational GenAI and retrieval strategies
✅ Build AI agents and RAG pipelines using AWS Bedrock
✅ Programmatically invoke agents and integrate with applications

Create vector indexes in Neo4j
Build GraphRAG pipelines using hybrid retrieval strategies 
Part 3 – Advanced Agents & API Integration (Advanced)
What You’ll Learn
Programmatic invocation of no-code Aura Agents
REST API and OAuth2 integration patterns
Using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for agent-based apps
Labs:

Build a programmatic client to invoke Aura Agent via REST
Implement OAuth2 client credentials flow


Lab 7 – Neo4j MCP Agent
Integrate MCP server tools with AWS AgentCore Gateway
Build LangGraph agent with natural language access to the Neo4j graph
Speaker/Talent Tips
Focus delivery on practical outcomes: each lab produces working code/agents.
Reframe GenAI concepts in business terms (semantic search, explainability).
Use real-world examples during demos (e.g., SEC 10-K knowledge graphs) — see repository context.
