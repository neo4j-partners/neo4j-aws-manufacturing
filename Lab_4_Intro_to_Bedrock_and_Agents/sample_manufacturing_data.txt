R2D2 is a next-generation robotic vehicle product currently under development. The product
encompasses four technology domains: Electric Powertrain, Chassis, Body, and Infotainment.

Components

The Electric Powertrain domain includes the HVB_3900 High-Voltage Battery, PDU_1500 Power
Distribution Unit, INV_2300 Inverter, and EMC_1800 E-Machine. The Chassis domain covers the
SUS_4200 Suspension and BRK_3800 Brakes systems. The Body domain includes EXT_5600 Exterior
and INT_6700 Interior components, along with SEA_7500 Seats.

Requirements

The HVB_3900 High-Voltage Battery has extensive engineering requirements covering battery cell
and module design, housing and structural integrity, high-voltage wiring and connectors,
thermal management, energy management, electrical safety, durability and lifecycle, crash
safety, and electromagnetic compatibility. Each requirement includes detailed specifications
in both German and English.

Testing

Requirements are validated through structured test sets containing individual test cases.
For example, the Cell Design Tests (TS_1_1) include test cases for Voltage, Capacity,
Energy Density, and Power Density. Test cases track status (Planned, Passed, Failed,
In Progress), required resources, duration, schedule, and responsible engineer.

Defects

Testing has identified several defects including DEF001 (energy density does not meet
specifications, High severity), DEF003 (high voltage interlock system not functioning
correctly, Critical severity), and DEF005 (battery management system communication failure,
High severity). Defects are tracked with severity, priority, assigned engineer, and
resolution status.

Change Proposals

Change proposals address issues found during development. CP001 proposes increasing energy
density requirements to meet Chinese standards (development cost: $500,000). CP002 proposes
enhancing water ingress protection to IP68 (development cost: $250,000). CP003 addresses
compliance with Chinese national standards for high-voltage wiring (development cost: $300,000).
