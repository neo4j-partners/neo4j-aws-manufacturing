# Lab 4: Intro to Bedrock and Agents

## Part 2 Begins

Welcome to the **coding labs**! In Part 1 you built a no-code agent. Now you'll learn how agents work under the hood.

## What You'll Learn

- How to configure and invoke Amazon Bedrock models
- The basics of LangGraph agent architecture
- How to define tools that an LLM can call
- The ReAct pattern: reasoning and acting in a loop
