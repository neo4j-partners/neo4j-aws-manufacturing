# The Integration Problem

## Before MCP

Connecting an AI agent to external tools required:

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Custom code** | Build integration for each tool |
| **Different auth** | Handle authentication per service |
| **Unique formats** | Parse tool-specific responses |
| **Manual lifecycle** | Manage connections yourself |

## The Scale Problem

If you have:
- 5 AI applications
- 10 data sources

You need **50 custom integrations**.

## The Dream

One protocol that any AI agent can use to connect to any data source.

That's **MCP**.
