# Testing Your Agent

## Sample Questions by Tool Type

### Cypher Templates
- "Tell me about the HVB_3900 component and its requirements"
- "Compare requirements between HVB_3900 and PDU_1500"

### Similarity Search
- "What do the requirements say about thermal management and cooling?"
- "Find requirements related to safety monitoring"

### Text2Cypher
- "Which component has the most requirements?"
- "How many defects have high severity?"

## What to Observe

For each question, check:
1. **Which tool** did the agent select?
2. **What context** was retrieved?
3. **How** was the response synthesized?
